LC4 ISA Interpreter Simulator
=============================

The program takes a binary .obj file as an input and demonstrates the behavior
of an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cse372/LC4.pdf?raw=true">
LC4 ISA</a> interpreter by outputting the trace file that shows the sequence of
16-bit instructions executed by the interpreter. See the <a target="_blank" href="Full spec.pdf">
full spec</a> for detailed information.

To run:
-------
1. ```cd``` to the root directory;
2. run ```./trace output_filename first.obj second.obj third.obj```.
